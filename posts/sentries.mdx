If you're here, you might have seen my other posts [HERE](rogue-shark-2500) and [HERE](degenerate-ape-academy-1051) about the other NFT projects that hold some significance to me. I own others that I don't post about and I have traded in and out of over a dozen projects in the last twelve months or so. Today, I'm writing about an NFT project which I've been advising on and I'm quite bullish on the overall concept. 
  
[Sentries](https://www.sentries.io/) is a Solana-based pfp NFT project where the funds raised from the mint go into a Solana Validator node to help grow the network, improve the Nakamoto Coefficient, which represents the number of Validators the would have to collude together to successfully slow down or interrupt the blockchain. The higher the number, the better. At the time of this writing, Solana currently sits at 31, while Ethereum sits at 34. This is a big deal for the legitimacy of the chains from a decentralization perspective. There are a lot of details that are probably best explained in the official Sentries white paper, which you can find [HERE](https://whitepaper.sentries.io/). 
  
In my role as an adviser for the project, I got to learn quite a lot about the team, the intention, the technology, and how it was all planned to come together. There are a few things that stood out for me when reviewing things. 
  
* The project has real utility. It's not a gimmick or a far fetched idea. It's just a practical use of the technologies to help grow the network sustainably.  
* The investment has tangible value, insofar as your purchase means you're a shareholder in the assets used to store the network. Most NFT projects can't claim anything real other than being a perpetual hype engine which will see its value rise and fall with the success of that engine. This has real value that grows over time as the profits from the Validator increase over time along with royalties being reinvested from secondary sales via smart contract rules.  
* This isn't a project to flip in and out of. You'll want to grab it and hold it as the value increases over time. I expect to see far lower inventory than normal projects on the secondary markets as a result.  
* The Sentries team has put their money and time where their mouth is and have already delivered the working Validator that is highly rated and collecting stake, having already attracted over 19,000 SOL by working with the staking pools such as Marinade and people in the community staking their own SOL. You can view their validator [HERE](https://solanabeach.io/validator/LodezVTbz3v5GK6oULfWNFfcs7D4rtMZQkmRjnh65gq) and [HERE](https://www.validators.app/validators/LodeuWMHPiPj2PUHUyca2bkpFv9HyzR3gaDBmGJ9TSS?locale=en&network=mainnet&order=&refresh=). 
  
While this bear market is certainly not the best time to launch a project, it's clear that this team means business and their ability to draw interest from the community shouldn't be overlooked. At the time of this writing there are over 13,000 people in Discord and over 15,400 Twitter followers, who are real people engaging in the community. There are more and more people signing up to be investors and buy large blocks of units making this a guaranteed sellout as the core team has had to start turning people away from collaborations and investment to give the general public an opportunity to own and participate as well. 
  
The artwork itself is pretty interesting and different from a style perspective. My interpretation of it is that it exists as less of a recognizable pfp (profile picture) and more of an art piece that's a representation of its utility and purpose to protect and serve the Solana network. So, without any further commentary, I would like to introduce you to my custom 1:1 Sentries pfp NFT that the team was nice enough to create specially for me. The mint is Friday, August 19th and I cannot wait!
