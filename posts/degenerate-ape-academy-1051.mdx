In my [first post](rogue-shark-2500) on this site, I talked about my beloved Rogue Shark NFT and how he came to me and why it meant a lot. Today, I share with you even more enthusiasm for [Degenerate Ape Academy #1051](https://howrare.is/degenapes/1051/).  
  
Given my history with Solana as a customer, I love all things Solana and have watched the happenings on the chain closely. One of my first memories was watching the chain explode due to the mint of the Degenerate Ape Academy NFT project. The mint wasn't perfect but it was so hyped and there was so much activity that Solana price exploded kicking off what would become the largest NFT platform in the world. That mint holds a piece of history that those long enough in the game respect as the OG Blue Chip NFT project on Solana.  
  
Fast forward to now, I was very lucky enough to be invited to the Solana event on Thursday, June 23rd having no idea what the announcement was about. I was even more fortunate enough to be able to bring my 15 year old daughter, LunarCurve as well. During the announcement we were literally front row behind the press, in the center. The announcement of SMS and the Saga phone left us open-mouthed in shock and even more excited about Solana than ever. It was at the event I noticed that Anatoly, the Solana CEO had on a Degenerate Ape Academy shirt. He even mentioned in a tweet afterwards that it was "The apes that started it all".  
  
I've been looking at this collection since it first minted but never had the courage to spend that much money on an NFT. A few weeks ago a friend of mine was with me in Austin for the Consensus Conference as the market was falling even further and he suggested that I look at the historically great NFT projects which have dropped floors because people wanted liquidity. Again, I didn't have the courage to pull the trigger despite the collection floor having dropped from 94.5 SOL on April 1st, 2022 to 44 SOL in the most recent days. I had looked but none listed sparked the "MINE!" response that I had with my RSC #2500.  
  
That was until today when I saw DAA #1051 and by then the floor had risen from 44 SOL to 54.9 SOL. I knew I had to get him, but I am in New York without my Ledger so I was stuck. I mentioned this to the same friend who very nicely offered to pick him up and hold him until I got home to pay him back. What a great friend! So I asked him to pull the trigger and I couldn't be more excited.  
  
When I got home, I paid my friend, and he got me the NFT. To my delight, I also noticed that the floor price right now for the wet suit clothing is 82 SOL. I am overjoyed.
