##While I had been an early fan, joining the Rogue Sharks Discord when there were only 400 people in, the fan base boomed quickly over 31,000 people at the time of the mint. Given the limited collection of sharks available, the RSC development team worked with Solana to implement the first ever fair launch lottery process on the Solana block chain. Unfortunately, I was unable to mint because I was not selected in the lottery. 

After watching the after market sales on Solanart (https://solanart.io/collections/roguesharks) for a few weeks, I noticed someone talking about #2500 in Discord and how it was such a clean looking shark. I quickly jumped onto Solanart and picked it up for 12 SOL. With 7 traits, middle of the pack rating, and an overall good composition, I have no regrets.
